# Moderation-and-Mediation-Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis exploring the moderation and mediation relationships governing the link between social and financial performance. The moderation analysis is conducted using panel data random effects regression with interaction terms, while the mediation analysis measures direct and indirect effects, identifying key pathways between dependent and independent variables using the Baron and Kenny (1986) approach.

The code is structured under the following sections for both moderation and mediation analyses:

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Model Diagnostic Checks
3. Moderation Analysis
4. Mediation Analysis
5. Robustness Assessment
